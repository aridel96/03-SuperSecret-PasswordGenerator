# 03-SuperSecret-PasswordGenerator

## Description
Challenge Project 3 from the University of Minnesota FullStack Coding Program

This project uses the starter code provided in the HTML and CSS files, and refactors the code to add styling to the webpage and make both files compatible with Javascript. 

The focus of this project is to use Javascript to make the webpage interactive.

Through this project I've learned more about the Document Object Model, Javascript and interactivity. Through these topics I've also learned about Javascript events and how to handle those events using methods such as addEventListener.
